# OrderedArrayList

1) for the NoNullArrayList, it is similar to an ArrayList, except it doesn't allow Nulls to be added as elements (will throw IllegalArgumentException when null is added)

-default constructor: don't take in a parameter
-2nd constructor: won't have nulls after the filled spaces because startingCapacity

-any comparable object has a .compareTo() method;
