# OrderedArrayList

NoNullArrayList IS an ArrayList; there are no instance variables, just changing the way some of the ArrayList methods work

1) for the NoNullArrayList, it is similar to an ArrayList, except it doesn't allow Nulls to be added as elements (will throw IllegalArgumentException when null is added)

-default constructor: don't take in a parameter \n
-2nd constructor: won't have nulls after the filled spaces because startingCapacity

-any comparable object has a .compareTo() method;
